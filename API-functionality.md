Previously I would have used the word API with absolutely no understanding of what it was, and even now I would say I have just enough understanding to want to know more. APIs govern a functional processes that applications use to communicate, gather, process and use data in multiple sources. They communicate in common languages between platforms (which often governs language choice) and essentially function to share and process databases. This means that, in particular for BDUF, you need to be very careful in planning out the exact requirements of each API early on in order to avoid any procedural mistakes that can sink a software. small-task focused work on the other hand presents a bit more flexibility around building APIs, but in truth when building APIs for a service being mistake free is essential.

In crafting APIs, it is particularly important to communicate fully what the actual end goal of the product should be, and how and why's of the particular process within that functionality. Every detail can never be covered, so it is important to communicate throughout the process, to wireframe and to demonstrate key parts of functionality early on to the client. Explain limitations of different languages upfront of course, and push back when you need to.
