Previously I would think about developing software as asking for a set of requirements and waiting for the final software outcome to test it. Now I understand it as a continuous communication process with the developers in which you provide them gradually with the building blocks you need to get your vision. By dividing the complete process into little tasks between several hours and 3-4 days long, you are able to focus on the most relevant parts of the program, get to have a higher control and continuous feedback from the developers on the development process, have a viable product earlier on that the customer can already try, simplify the work of programmers and maximize their efficiency, and many other advantages. It consists in breaking apart the project into a viable workplan. It helps you prioritize and being focused on what you really need and it’s important. In this way, the designing process is leaner and equipped to adapt to the any changes derived from the different needs that may arise.

Moreover, the Kanban methodology sits nicely on top of this process. It is perfectly adapted for an operation with numerous individual tasks to be performed in an orderly way, thinking of the development flow as a production line. It improves the efficiency in the process minimizing the idle times, keeping track of things, and helping developers to stay focuses in one task at a time. It also distributes responsibilities with clear roles and simplifies the management work. Kanban not only applies to software development, it is a very popular methodology that is also used in software maintentenance, or by companies like Spotify or investment banks. And despite all its benefits, it is a really simple system to follow.
