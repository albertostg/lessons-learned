Professor Bell´s insight into the Lean Startup Approach and how we can best maximize learning and minimize the cost and
time it takes to learn was valuable for me. The analysis for which Minimum Viable Products (MVP) best optimize learning was
useful as I now have steps I can follow to do things that do not scale in the early days such as: 
•	Landing Page MVP  - allowing me to validate a binary validation of interest 
•	Email Based MVP 
•	Video – creating a video to show how the product would work and letting it go viral on its own 
•	Wizard of Oz  - doing yourself what the software would do behind the scenes
•	Hustle – don´t have the product yet, but pre-sell it to a bunch of people and use the money earned to build the actual product
•	Concierge 
•	Piece Meal 

Likewise, Bell´s analysis into how to specify software will help me add value to future conversations I have with engineering teams. The differences he described between Big Design Up Front (BDUF) and incremental software development are important. Most likely, I will not find myself in a BDUF situation so understanding the vision of the software and being able to put smart people in a room and ensure they have autonomy to make their own  decisions interacting together will be more valuable in the long run than having a formal process. The overview of hourly vs. fixed bids helped clarify my understanding of software development costs. In most cases, a fixed bid means that you´re paying for something you now know you don´t need and the interests on both sides can be misaligned. Time can be wasted arguing with the customer over explanations of why they can´t get what they want. It´s most important to first build trust with hourly development costs and make sure you´re comfortable with the working software and test frequent releases. The following estimates must be kept in mind: 
o	On average 50% of time, development estimate will be late 
o	Better to give a range (7-10 days) 
o	What is my economic incentive around this? 
o	Need to have about double the budget of the actual software cost
